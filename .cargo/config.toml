# Cargo configuration for cross-compilation
# The cross-rs tool manages linker and rustflags automatically via Docker containers
# No manual configuration needed for musl targets when using cross

# Uncomment below only if building natively (not with cross-rs)
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
# linker = "musl-gcc"
# rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+crt-static"]
